# Web-scraping
get information from a website, and place it in an Excel file



This project involved using Python along with the Selenium and OpenPyXL libraries to scrape and organize data from a specific website. 
The goal was to generate a list of workers by collecting and organizing information such as name, email, phone, and extension from the website. 
The project required proficiency in Python, as well as experience working with web scraping tools such as Selenium and libraries for working with Excel files such as OpenPyXL. 
The final Excel document was titled "Liste de travailleurs" and excluded people without phone numbers, retired individuals, and those associated with the company "Ordre des géologues du Québec."
